  What is Faban?
  --------------
  Faban is a benchmark automation tool and development framework. It is
  practically the consolidation of the team's benchmark development and
  management knowledge. The driver framework provides a simple yet mature
  framework for benchmark development. The harness is all about automation
  of benchmark runs and data collection, and is managed using a web interface.

  There are three download packages:
    - Server package. This is for the Faban server. If you drive and control
      the benchmark from a single server, this all you need. The file is named
      faban-0.7-server-mmddyy.tar.gz

    - Client package. This is needed for all additional systems in you rig,
      except the server. The file is named
      faban-0.7-client-mmddyy.tar.gz

    - Bundling package. This includes the server, client, and a build scripts
      for integrating and shipping Faban with other benchmarks. The file
      is named
      faban-0.7-bundle-mmddyy.tar.gz

  Note that the mmddyy in the file name refers to the build date of the package.
